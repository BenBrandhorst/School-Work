      <p>The original Bullet Space Pen was conceived in July of 1948 by Paul Fisher, who was soon machining a new pen 
	  design shaped from solid aluminum. This became our first Fisher ball point pen, the #400 Bullet Pen, and arguably 
	  the most popular pen of the twentieth century. This pen is now composed of all brass with a chrome finish. Cited 
	  as an outstanding example of industrial art, the classic design of the Fisher Bullet Pen has been exhibited for 
	  years in the New York Museum of Modern Art. The Bullet's timeless styling has been the topic of many art books and 
	  magazine articles. Often imitated but never duplicated, the Fisher Bullet Space Pen continues to be our most popular 
	  pen. .</p>
