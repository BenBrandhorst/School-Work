      <p> 3oz (90ml) glass bottle of Noodler's Grey fountain pen ink. Noodler's inks are handcrafted, 
	  so there may be slight color variations from batch to batch.  </p>
	  
	  <p>Noodler's inks are known for their affordability, wide range of colors, and good performance on more absorbent 
	  papers that are not normally fountain pen friendly. They are also known for their distinctive label art, featuring 
	  unique drawings that often reflect their creator's strongly held political and economic ideals. Dedicated to keeping 
	  prices as low as possible, Noodler's uses simple bottles and packaging, with boxes made of recycled paper. All 
	  Noodler's inks are 100% made in the USA. </p>
