      <p>The LAMY Safari is a workhorse pen, known throughout the fountain pen community for its ruggedness, 
	  reliability, and no-nonsense functionality. The triangular grip makes it great for those starting out who 
	  have no idea how to hold a fountain pen, but it's used and loved by fountain pen lovers of all levels of 
	  experience. This matte charcoal dark grey Safari comes with an interchangeable black steel nib, which can 
	  be easily swapped out for another size. This fountain pen comes with a blue LAMY ink cartridge so you can 
	  get started writing right away. If you'd like to use bottled fountain pen ink, you can also purchase a 
	  LAMY Z28 converter.</p>
