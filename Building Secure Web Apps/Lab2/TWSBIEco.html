	  <h2> Price: $29.99 </h2>
      <p>The TWSBI ECO fountain pen boasts an incredible value with its piston filling system and affordable price.
	  Like many other TWSBI fountain pens, it features a crystal clear acrylic barrel so you can see your ink level, 
	  and a solid white cap. The pen cap has an inner cap to ensure a perfect seal when stored away. It is completed 
	  with silver trim and a silver stainless steel nib. </p>
	
	<p>TWSBI's belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely 
	experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a 
	wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for 
	long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, 
	as the feed is very fragile.</p>
