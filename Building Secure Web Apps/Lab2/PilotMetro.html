      <p>A fantastic value from Pilot, the Metropolitan is a favorite first fountain pen. This black metal bodied pen 
	  has a glossy black accent band, silver trim, and a steel nib. It comes with a squeeze converter and a black Pilot 
	  ink cartridge, or you can upgrade to a CON-40 twist piston converter to use bottled ink if you prefer. It comes 
	  packaged in a gift box.</p>
